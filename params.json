{"name":"Seagoatvision","tagline":"SeaGoatVision is a vision server to develop and execute filter on different media. The software is entirely written in Python and the filters can be written in both C++ or Python. ","body":"SeaGoatVision\r\n=============\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n--------------\r\nSeaGoatVision is a computer vision system running into a server.\r\n\r\nActually, this platform is used to doing robotic.\r\n\r\nPrincipal feature :\r\n - Manage multiple client and media\r\n - Run filterchain\r\n - Control filter by parameters\r\n - Give environnement for debug and create filter\r\n - Run in local or in remote\r\n - Can send message to other platform\r\n - Execute Python and C++ filters\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-------------\r\nBe sure to read the INSTALL.md file.\r\n\r\nOperating instructions\r\n---------------------------\r\nRead HOWTO.md file.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------\r\nRead LICENSE file.\r\n\r\nContact information\r\n------------------------\r\nGo on website https://github.com/Octets/SeaGoatVision and create an issue.\r\n\r\nKnown bugs\r\n---------------\r\nThe bugs is showing in issues of the project : https://github.com/Octets/SeaGoatVision/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n-------------------\r\nThe project is only supported in python 2.7, because opencv is not supported in python 3 at this moment.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n---------\r\nThanks club Capra and club Sonia to support us.\r\n\r\n - http://capra.etsmtl.ca\r\n - https://sonia.etsmtl.ca\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n----------------\r\n - 0.2 : version with Qt graphic interface, GTK is removed. Integrate Firewire camera, client/server with Protobuf, add parameters between client and filter/media. The analyser of filter and the camera Ethernet is removed temporary.\r\n - 0.1 : version with GTK graphic interface. Ready for the Capra competition. Can create and run filterchain, reload filters, save parameters, observer filters output, run python and c++ filters, and record video.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
